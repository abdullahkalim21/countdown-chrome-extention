# Countdown Timer Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension displays a dynamic countdown timer in every new tab. The extension allows users to set a countdown for a specific event, or track the remaining time.

## Features
- *__Lifespan Countdown:__* Set a countdown for an event or specific deadline.
- *__Goal Deadline:__* Track the time remaining for important goals or projects.
- *__Random Motivational Quotes:__* Each time a new tab is opened, a random quote is displayed to inspire productivity and time management.
- *__Local Storage Support:__* The extension saves the timer state, so it continues from where it left off even after the browser is closed.
